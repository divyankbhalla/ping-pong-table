## How it Works
It is designed to keep score of 2 players playing ping pong. We can select maximum points for which players are playing the game between 3 to 11. As a player gets a point we can increase there tally by clicking on respected player button. As soon as a player gets the maximum points a popup screen will appeare declaring the winner of the game. We also have a button to restart the game.
